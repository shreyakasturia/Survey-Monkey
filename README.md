# Survey Monkey Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of survey data collected via Survey Monkey. The data was cleaned using Excel and manipulated using Python to derive insights as per the client's requirements.

## Client Requirements
1. Determine the number of respondents who answered a particular question.
2. Identify the number of respondents who provided the same answer to a question.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data cleaning
- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis

## Implementation
The implementation of this project can be summarized in the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data from Survey Monkey was imported into Excel. Various cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format the data properly.
2. **Data Manipulation**: The cleaned data was then exported to a Excel file and loaded into a Python script. Using pandas and other relevant libraries, the data was manipulated to count the number of respondents for each question and to tally identical answers.

## Results
The results of the analysis were compiled into a report, highlighting the number of respondents for each question and the frequency of identical answers. These insights helped the client understand the distribution of responses and identify common patterns in the survey data.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Contains the raw and cleaned data files.
- **script/**: Contains the Python script used for data manipulation.
- **output/**: Contains the final report generated from the analysis.
